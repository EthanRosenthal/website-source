    "We all know that Python has [risen](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/26/python-is-becoming-the-worlds-most-popular-coding-language) above its humble beginnings such that it now powers [billion dollar companies](https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366). Let's not forget Python's roots, though! It's still an excellent language for running quick and dirty scripts that automate some task. While this works fine for automating my own tasks because I know how to navigate the command line, it's a bit much to ask a layperson to somehow install python and dependencies, open Terminal on a Mac (god help you if they have a Windows computer), type a random string of characters, and hit enter. Ideally, you would give the layperson a button, they hit it, and they get their result.\n",

The library is worth it for the detailed [OAuth page](https://datasheets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_oauth_credentials.html) alone (I once spent 2 weeks struggling with Google OAuth pain and _really_ wish this page had existed at that time). What's particularly nice about the OAuth page is that it walks through setting up a _service account_ which does not require the end-user to go through the typical OAuth dance of browser redirects to and from the Google login page. This is nce because these redirects can get messed up when moving from local development to production systems in the cloud (or at least they always get messed up when I try to do it!).\n",

It is an integer variable because we cannot screen a movie on 2.5 screens.\n",

Let's define a quantity $r_{m}$ which is the amount of money that we expect movie $m$ to bring in (this is the revenue column in the above DataFrame). Our objective function is then simply\n",

You get charged <span>$</span>2 million for every screen that you leave empty. We can incorporate this into our optimization problem by assuming that there is an _extra_ movie called \"Empty Screen\" and that the expected revenue for that movie is _negative_ <span>$</span>2 million. Our two constraints can now be defined:\n",
