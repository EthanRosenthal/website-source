    "*tl;dr -> I collected an implicit feedback dataset along with side-information about the items. This dataset contains around 62,000 users and 28,000 items. All the data lives [here](https://github.com/EthanRosenthal/rec-a-sketch/tree/master/data) inside of [this](https://github.com/EthanRosenthal/rec-a-sketch) repo. Enjoy!*\n",

    "In a previous [post]({filename}/2016-01-09-explicit-matrix-factorization-als-sgd.md), I wrote about how to use matrix factorization and explicit feedback data in order to build recommendation systems. This is data where a user has given a clear preference for an item such as a star rating for an Amazon product or a numerical rating for a movie like in the [MovieLens](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) data. A natural next step is to discuss recommendation systems for implicit feedback which is data where a user has shown a *preference* for an item like \"number of minutes listened\" for a song on Spotify or \"number of times clicked\" for a product on a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit feedback-based techniques likely consitute the majority of modern recommender systems. When I set out to write a post on these techniques, I found it difficult to find suitable data. This makes sense - most companies are loathe to share users' click or usage data (and for good reasons). A cursory google search revealed a couple datasets that people use, but I kept finding issues with these datasets. For example, the million song database was shown to have [some](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/blog/12-1-2-matching-errors-taste-profile-and-msd) [issues](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/blog/12-2-12-fixing-matching-errors) with data quality, while many [other](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-33486-3_5) [people](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2799671) just repurposed the MovieLens or Netflix data as though it was implicit (which it is not).\n",
