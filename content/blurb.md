Welcome!

I am a New York City-based data scientist. On this site, you can learn more [about me]({{< ref "/about" >}}), read my [data blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}), wade through some [idle thoughts]({{< ref "/idle" >}}), or take a tour through an old, [hand-coded website](https://physics.ethanrosenthal.com) from my Physics days.

Enjoy!
