Welcome!

I am a New York City-based data scientist. On this site, you can learn more [about me]({{< ref "/about" >}}), read my [data blog]({{< ref "/blog" >}}), wade through some [idle thoughts]({{< ref "/idle" >}}), take a tour through an old, [hand-coded website](https://physics.ethanrosenthal.com) from my Physics days, or even venture out of nerd world and onto my [boat](https://boat.ethanrosenthal.com).

Honestly, though, the blog is the main point. Here are some greatest hits to get you started:

- [Optimal Peanut Butter and Banana Sandwiches]({{< ref "/blog/optimal-peanut-butter-and-banana" >}})
- [Matrix Factorization in PyTorch]({{< ref "/blog/matrix-factorization-in-pytorch" >}})
- [Intro to Recommender Systems: Collaborative Filtering]({{< ref "/blog/intro-to-collaborative-filtering" >}})
- [Time Series for scikit-learn People (Part II): Autoregressive Forecasting Pipelines]({{< ref "/blog/time-series-for-scikit-learn-people-part2" >}})

Enjoy!
