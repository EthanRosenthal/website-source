## Bio

Ethan Rosenthal lives in New York City and works at [Runway](https://runwayml.com/). Prior to Runway, he worked in [big tech]({{< ref "/blog/2024-01-14-big-company-bachelors.md" >}}), [freelance consulted]({{< ref "/blog/freelance-ds-consulting" >}}), and worked at [some](https://www.dia.com/) [startups](https://www.birchbox.com/). Before working in tech, Ethan got a [PhD](https://physics.ethanrosenthal.com/) in Physics from Columbia University building atomic-resolution microscopes to study superconductors.

## Speaking

Having suffered through years of dry physics talks during my academic days, I'm on a mission to give data science talks that are engaging and interesting while still delivering technical insights for the audience.
