My name is Ethan Rosenthal, and I write a blog about data science called [Data Piques](https://blog.ethanrosenthal.com).

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Dia&Co](https://dia.com). I lead a team of scientists, engineers, and analysts focused on Styling and Customer Growth algorithms. I got my start in data science working at [Birchbox](https://www.birchbox.com). Prior to that, I earned a PhD in Physics from [Columbia University](http://physics.columbia.edu/) where I studied unconvential superconductors.

I would love to hear from you. Feel free to contact me at ethanrosenthal(at)gmail.com
