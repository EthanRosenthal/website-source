## Talks

Having suffered through years of dry physics talks during my academic days, I'm on a mission to give data science talks that are engaging and interesting while still delivering technical insights for the audience.

### Upcoming Talks

- [Model Remodeling with Modern Deep Learning Frameworks](https://www.scipy2019.scipy.org/talks-posters/Model-Remodeling-with-Modern-Deep-Learning-Frameworks), SciPy 2019


### Past Talks

- [Empowering the Humans in the Loop by Synthesizing Machine Learning and Optimization](http://texasaisummit.com/2019/sessions), Texas AI Summit 2019
- [Making the Machines Work for Us](https://www.theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/machine-learning-innovation-summit-new-york-2018/agenda), Machine Learning Innovation Summit 2018
- [Scaling Personalization via Machine-Learned Assortment Optimization](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/scaling-personalization-via-machine-learned-assortment-optimization), DataEngConf 2018 ([video](https://youtu.be/1_wjsY6eSFs), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/rosentep/scaling-personalization-via-machinelearned-assortment-optimization))
- [Diving into the deep end of clothing styles](https://pydata.org/nyc2017/schedule/presentation/18/), PyData 2017 ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm4ZQMKoz7Q), [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/rosentep/diving-into-the-deep-end-of-clothing-styles-pydata-nyc-2017))
