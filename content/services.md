My goal is to empower your company to extract value from your data. Please reach out at <hello@ethanrosenthal.com> - I would love to hear from you.

I offer a range of services for companies of all sizes. Whether you are an early-stage startup who has heard the buzz about data science but is unsure of how it works in practice or you are a mature company with an established data team and more projects than people, let's [talk](mailto:hello@ethanrosenthal.com). 

As a PhD-trained physicist who subsequently spent years building and deploying production machine learning systems from scratch, I cover the broad spectrum of modern data science from mathematical modeling to production-ready software engineering. My key service areas include:

- Machine Learning Products
- Optimization and Automation
- Analytics
- Data Strategy and Vision
- Recruiting and Hiring
