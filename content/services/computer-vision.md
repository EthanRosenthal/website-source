I was originally introduced to computer vision and image analysis techniques during my PhD when I analyzed atomic-resolution microscopy images. Since then, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, and I have kept pace with the developments through both [personal projects]({{< ref "/blog/recasketch-keras/index.md" >}}) and [industry products](https://youtu.be/Pm4ZQMKoz7Q) where I repurposed a facial recognition algorithm in order to build a visual similarity search product from scratch. I am particularly interested in companies with image data, so please reach out if you do.
