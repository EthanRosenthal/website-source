While nobody can forecast the future, algorithms can definitely help and reduce uncertainty. Time-series forecasting has long been a [personal]({{< ref "/blog/time-series-for-scikit-learn-people-part1/index.md" >}}) [interest]({{< ref "/blog/time-series-for-scikit-learn-people-part2/index.md" >}}) of [mine](https://github.com/ethanrosenthal/skits). I have also commonly seen and built solutions to time-series problems in industry. For example, forecasting of inventory levels is essential for ecommerce companies to manage cashflow, and modeling and decomposition of time-level data is essential for both _understanding_ processes as well as identifying anomalies.

Coming from an experimental physics background building scientific instrumentation and dealing with noisy data acquisition, I am particularly interested in companies with remote sensor data, from industrial sensors to drone images.
